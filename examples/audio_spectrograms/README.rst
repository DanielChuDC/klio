Vocal Seperation & Spectrogram Generation
=========================================

Separate vocals from instrumentals of a song and generate respective
spectrograms.

This example adapts the `librosa <https://librosa.org/>`_ `example
<https://librosa.org/doc/latest/auto_examples/plot_vocal_separation.html>`_
for separating vocals from instrumental, and then generates and saves
spectrograms based off of the separated files.

Please refer to the `accompanying walk-through <https://docs.klio.io/en
/latest/userguide/examples/audio_spec.html>`_.
